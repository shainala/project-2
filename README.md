Analysis
Scope of the Project:

The scope of the project is to generate the data-driven analytics around the Mental Health sector on the basis of historical insurance and claims being paid by the patients of the State New York from 2014 to 2018 to facilitate the decision to build strategies. Given certain characteristics (features) of the health care insurance company, build applicable predictive models for key metrics such as Paid Claim Total using the provided dataset.

Business Question :
The objective of the model are as follows :
i.	To identify the patterns of people opting for Mental Health Insurance.
ii.	To identify the features/characteristics that needs to be focused upon for better enrollment in the Medicaid packages.
 
Tools , Languages , Python Packages Used in the Project :

As a part of our project, we have used Python and APACHE SPARK as a part of our data analytics tool.
We have also used Jupyter Notebook.
We have used Python as a Language for the coding and generating results.
Packages used are as follows :
•	Pyspark : Pyspark provides an interface for Apache Spark in Python which enables to write Spark applications using Python APIs, and also provides the PySpark shell. 
•	NumPy : provides a high-performance multidimensional array object, and tools for working with these arrays.
•	Pandas : Package PANDAS are used to create Dataframes and perform multiple data manipulation techniques which is highly useful for data analysis.
•	Matplotlib : Package Matplotlib is used to create  2-dimensional graphs and plots. Mostly, for Exploratory Data Analysis purposes, we often build multiple plots, to find the relationships between the different characteristics. This is possible through Matplotlib.
•	Sklearn : Package sklearn is the most efficient and robust package that provides tools for machine learning and statistical modelling including classification, regression , clustering in Python.

Design and Data Collection Methods

•	Performing EDA on the dataset
We worked on the descriptive analytics to understand the variables in the dataset and get an understanding of the distribution of the dataset.

•	Feature engineering
Predictions models for the revenue generating portfolio in the Mental Health care treatment sector.
We have multiple sessions to constantly improvise our understanding of the knowledge in the domain especially the metrics that can impact the revenues in the healthcare sector. The utilization of how Big Data tools such as Spark, Python and Tableau can be utilized for benefitting investors in this scenario.

•	Data Preparation process

Data Preparation process: The datasets has been cleaned and pre-processed by considering the null values, handling of missing values accordingly.

Implementation Methodology and Strategies
•	Feature selection: can be conducted using the step selection process that includes forward and backward selection methods.
•	Building of Models: 2 different models that includes Linear Regression, Random Forest.

•	Qualitative analysis: Once final analysis is done, we will provide recommendations for revenue generating strategies.
